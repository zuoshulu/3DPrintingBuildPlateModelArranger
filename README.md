# 3D Printing Build Plate Model Arranger
Zuoshu Lu

The project has been developed using Visual Studio Code with GCC on Ubuntu Linux. 

I compiled my source code by command “g++ -o ModelArrange -g -I main.cpp *.cpp -std=c++17”

The testing program take a few command line arguments, for example 
“./ModelArrange 100 100 50 50 40 40 40 40 40 40”
